A simple application that randomly generates a pair of english words whenever the next button is pressed.

KEY NOTES:
ThemeData properties to set app colors and fonts accross the application
Working with VS CODE
Extracting widgets - compositing / composition - creating your own widgets like abstraction in OOP concept
Widgets are blue prints or configuration (to Elements) for pieces of an apps UI
Elements are displayed on the screen
The analysis_option.yaml: This file on Flutter applications determines how strict flutter should be when analysing your code
! is called Bang operator
colorScheme.onPrimary: In the ThemeData, finds a suitable color that fits the colorScheme.primary
MainAxisSize.min: Tells the Row or Column not to take all the available horizontal or vertical space as the case may be
Fail-fast Principle: prevents app crash during production e.g the switch statement that has a default should there be other case(s) that was not included
Wrap , FittedBox are Flutter widgets that make your app automatically responsive
Device-independent-pixels, also known as logical pixels. Approximately 36pixels per centimeter and 96pixels per inch
Flutter works with logical pixels as a unit of length in such case, LayoutBuilder() is ideal
CURRYING & LAMBDA expressions: Dart supports these functional programming features. Passing functions as arguments, assigning a function to a variable, deconstructing a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a simgle argument also called CURRYING, creating a nameless function that can be used as a constant value also called a LAMBDA EXPRESSION; Lambda expressions were added to Java in the JDK8 release.
